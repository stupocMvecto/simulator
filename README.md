# Video Editing With Templates
  
Creating custom templates in Figma Slides is only available on the Organization and Enterprise plans per the Figma Learn article. This is a basic feature of any presentation design software, even for decks designed entirely by individuals.

Makes no sense that you cannot do this with a Pro account. Messy that you cannot create templates with styling that you have saved with your Pro account in Figma. For me, working as the only designer at a smaller agency, it is unreasonable to go from $15 to $45 a month to be able to publish presentation templates.
 
Building blocks are reusable pieces of content or other document parts that are stored in galleries to be accessed and reused at any time. You can also save building blocks and distribute them with templates.

For example, perhaps you have a three-paragraph disclaimer. If you use the Group command to group the three paragraphs, the three-paragraph disclaimer cannot be edited and can be deleted only as a group.
 
You can add protection to individual content controls in a template to help prevent someone from deleting or editing a particular content control or group of controls, or you can help protect all of the template content with a password.
 
Select the Content control cannot be deleted check box, which allows the content of the control to be edited but the control itself cannot be deleted from the template or a document that is based on the template.
 
Use this setting when you want to protect text if it is included. For example, if you often include a disclaimer, you can help ensure that the text stays the same, and you can delete the disclaimer for documents that don't require it.
 
Use strong passwords that combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Weak passwords don't mix these elements. Strong password: Y6dh!et5. Weak password: House27. Passwords should be at least 8 characters long. In general, longer a password is, the more secure it is.
 
I have an automated process (using arcpy of course) that will create a service draft and publish a feature class from a gdb successfully. Once the service is up, I can edit existing features and play around with related records in ArcGIS Online and Field Maps. However, when I try to add new features I am unable to because of a default value conflicting with an existing value in the feature class, even though I tried to save with a different value.
 
I understand that this can be remedied in the feature class' feature template in Desktop as well as Map Viewer Classic, but I am having a couple of issues I was wondering if I could get some help with:
 
1) According to this link: 
 -online/manage-data/manage-feature-templates.htm

I should be able to manage feature templates in Map Viewer. But when I try to load a feature service into a map and click on "Edit", the "Manage" button does not appear. I understand that I can only see this button if I am the owner or admin, but I am not clear on what that means. Is the owner the person that published the service or the one that adds it to the map? When I try to set the sharing properties to the admin only and have to log in to view the layer in map viewer, I am still not able to see the "Manage" button. Additionally, adding it to a map in ArcGIS Online Content under a different account does not allow me to see the "Manage" button either.
 
EDIT: I should also mention that the layer is on one of our ArcGIS Servers and I am adding the layer to the map by using the feature service link. I am also not able to add the feature service to my ArcGIS Online content due to a generic error when trying to add it.
 
You can only change templates and types in Map Viewer Classic and Field Maps if the layer is a hosted feature layer. Since your layer is not a hosted feature layer (it's hosted by a separate ArcGIS Server) you cannot change them.
 
For hosted feature layers, you can script this or make modifications directly at the REST endpoint via updateDefinition. This is not possible for non-hosted feature layers. I'm not sure if you can automate this with arcpy prior to publishing.
 
This answer may just save my bacon, but I'm curious, for the prototype part, do you need to include all the attributes of the feature layer or just the attributes that you wish to add with a default value set?

Many thanks!
 
Haven't played with this in a while, but I would say the only fields that you want with a default. If you have fields defined as not nullable and no default value in prototype and no input value in the form, then it's not going to work (if I remember correctly).
 
I just delt with this issue. The only way I could update templates (add new ones in this case) was by using Map Viewer Classic. You can modify some default values in existing templates and change the display name in Field Maps Designer but you can't create new ones that don't retain at least one field that you can't change.
 
As far as I can see, the only way to find the templates is to create a new note and then click on the Templates button. And if you want to edit an existing template you need to make a new note, apply a template and then edit it. And save it again under a new name..
 
I'm using Evernote for Mac and I don't know how templates work on Windows. But I guess the same functionality would be requested on Windows as well. I also use evernote on my Android phone, but I haven't found the need to open a new template there yet.
 
I would love to see the ability to edit a template. The supplied ones are good but some have great features that when added to another template, would be perfect for the intended purpose. A design your own option would be awesome for iOS iPad penultimate
 
You have to be kidding that cannot edit saved templates. This is a must have feature and should be simple to allow. Creating a new note, applying a template, modifying it, saving it under a new name and deleting your original note is absurd. I though this was a program promoting efficiency????
 
I'm on the Windows client. You can access the template browser when applying to a new note, and you can rename there, but as far as I can tell there is no way to edit templates? Am I dumb or is this a design flaw? Please give us access to edit templates rather than resaving and deleting. To many extra steps that make the template feature not worth it.
 
Seriously, the Evernote staff really did not think the use of this feature through if they haven't provided a means to edit existing templates. I am a bit disappointed. I thought the feature would be great.
 
Easy - roll your own. Just save a note somewhere safe / convenient, and when you want a new instance, use the note copy or duplicate functionality to make a copy. In the WIndows client, you can preserve tags when you make a copy.
 
and then you need to delete the old templete ...yes, that is the only way to currently do it. A better option would be to provide a way to directly edit the existing template. As currently implemented I see no advantage to the template feature over the roll your own method we had been using.

I like choices too but I don't see why in this case the "simplified" templating function should need to be awful to edit in order to be simple. From my point of view the simplified process can stay the way it is now, with all its advantages. All that is really needed to support the not uncommon use case of editing a template is an option to access the list of templates without having to create a new note and a context menu entry to edit a template without having to create a new note. I don't see how that complicates anything, on the contrary the way it is implemented now is a major complication of the simple process of editing a template.
 
Sometimes I mess up, and fixing it is beyond obnoxious. It really is quite a pain to have to create a new note, select the template, make the changes, save as a new template (with a new modified name because you can't have two files with the same name) save as a new template.
 
I love using templates, and most of my notes are structured within a core set of them. It's such a great feature, but not being able to edit the templates outside of this process is hard to understand.
 
Well, I guess you might find the way I manage my templates to work better. I forego the integrated template database and just keep my templates in a separate notebook called "Templates" and use the Duplicate Note command. There are various ways to make quick access to them, such as adding favourites and setting Favourites Bar as a separate menu at top of screen. I also use Filterize service extensively to automatically apply templates triggered by defined rules. This is an amazing tool, if you're willing to put in time to set it up.
